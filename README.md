# Asthma-Managing-Device 
Our project helps to remind the user to take medication on time, helps them with proper usage of an inhaler, to count the number of puffs taken to track and update in Arduino IOT cloud (web/app interface) and remainders to restock/contact a local drug dealers if medicine content is low.
